# Myth's Dotfiles

This is a consolidation of my current setup with all applications that I use on
a daily basis. This is mostly a compilation of random scripts I found online, a
"clone" of my old dwm setup, and also some Lukesmithxyz scripts that I find
very useful. You can use if you want, but I can't promise I'll provide help.
Thanks for reading!
